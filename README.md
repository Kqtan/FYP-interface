# FYP-interface
<h>Technically, it's an FYP on Machine Learning for Email Filtering and Categorising</h>

<p>However, due to the lack of email data regarding the categorisation tasks. I am applying the AG news data instead.</p>
<p>Therefore, the interface will be based on the News architecture. You can still enter any email related to World, Business, Sports, or Sci/Tech and the model will still do the trick.</p>
