# FYP-interface
<h>Technically, it's an FYP on Machine Learning for Email Filtering and Categorising</h>

<p>However, due to the lack of email data regarding the categorisation tasks. I am applying the AG news data instead.</p>
<p>Therefore, the interface will be based on the News architecture. You can still enter any email related to World, Business, Sports, or Sci/Tech and the model will still do the trick.</p>

<p>I name the platform <heavy>Novum</heavy>, which means new in Latin, signifying that this is somehow a 'new' thing TO ME and it is a good experience to expose myself to machine learning and its deployment.
    I am keen to look for a Data Science job and am ready to take on any challenges with my current skills, hopefully, sharpen my skills if I were to join your team.</p>

<h3>I just need a chance to prove myself.</h3>
